# Dotfiles

A collection of my dotfiles. Running the installer will prompt you Y/N to
overwrite symlinks (`ln -sin`) for every file in this directory to your
home directory.


### Installation

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/m8ss/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

cd ~/.dotfiles

./.install.sh
```
