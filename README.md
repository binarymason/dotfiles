# Dotfiles
Sets up 'nix development environment using ansible.

# Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:binarymason/dotfiles.git ~/.files
cd ~/.files
./script/setup
```

# Notes
This assumes you already have ansible on your machine.  I'm lazy and haven't put ansible installation in the setup script yet.
